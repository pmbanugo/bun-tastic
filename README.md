# bun-tastic: static site hosting with Bun + Tigris

A high-performance web server that lets you serve multiple static websites from different S3 buckets through a single server. It's perfect for managing multiple static sites with their individual domains while keeping the hosting simple and efficient.

It uses [Tigris](https://www.tigrisdata.com/) for object storage and benefits from its global caching.

Bun-tastic uses Fly.io as its default deployment option, allowing you to set up global compute with a single command.

In other words, it's a high-performance, scalable, and efficient solution for hosting multiple static websites on your own terms.

## Features and Benefits ðŸ”¥

- Serve multiple static websites from one application
- Global distributed caching and compute
- Easy configuration through JSON
- Brotli & zstd compression (via Fly Proxy), with response streaming
- Built-in monitoring with Grafana dashboard (via Fly)
- Smart path handling with automatic index.html resolution
- Built on Bun's native S3 client and web server, thereby benefiting [from Bun's fast performance](https://x.com/jarredsumner/status/1877660347709972484)
- It's Lightweight. It uses zero dependency and can run on a single CPU with 256MB RAM
- Posssibility to add and configure middleware and that can handle extra needs like authorization, redirect/rewrite rules, etc.
- Possible cheap/affordable hosting with volume-based licensing on Fly and affordable Tigris storage.

### Planned Features

- CLI/API for simplified site uploads (with resumability)
- Per-machine/VM caching with cache invalidation (potential performance boost)
- 103 Early Hints support (more efficient page load times)
- Easy setup/config to run on multi-cores
- Configurable bot request blocking

## Performance

It's fast! But better to try it for yourself. Here's a sample from a local test:

![load testing and measuring response time](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1736875740269/531f0b7a-5b22-44f6-9156-57b5619f63f9.webp)

You can see that the response time is very low and more than have returned in less than 100ms, for a response of 6KiB in size. Now deploy this in the regions you want to get lower latency and faster response times.

> The server is a shared VM with 256MB RAM and 1 CPU running on fly.io. Deployed region is in Sweden (arn).
> Tested on a 2021 MacBook Pro with M1 chip. Average internet speed 200 - 300Mbps.
> Try it yourself at https://first.flycd.dev or https://second.flycd.dev

Here's a video of me sampling the load and response times:

## Usage Instructions

### Prerequisites

- Bun >= 1.1.43
- S3-compatible storage (like Tigris). Tigris is recommended for its global/distributed caching support.
- An account on Fly.io (optional)

### Configuration

1. Clone this repository
2. Copy config.example.json to config.json:
   ```bash
   cp config.example.json config.json
   ```
3. Update config.json with your domain to bucket mappings:
   ```json
   {
     "example.com": "my-bucket-name",
     "another-site.com": "another-bucket-name"
   }
   ```
4. If you intend to run it local, copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in your S3 credentials:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
5. For Fly.io deployment, add the secrets to the env after you deployed or created the app. You can add it from the dashboard or CLI. Here is an example using CLI:
   ```bash
   fly secrets set AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=<KEY_ID> AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=<ACCESS_KEY> AWS_REGION=auto AWS_ENDPOINT=https://fly.storage.tigris.dev
   ```

### Running Locally

To run bun-tastic locally ensure you have the minimum required version for Bun (`Bun >= 1.1.43`), the correct `.env` file and values, and the config (config.json).

Once you have confirmed that you have all of that in place, run `bun index.ts` to start the server.

> You can configure a local domain in `/etc/hosts` and use a tool like [Caddy](https://caddyserver.com/) to proxy the requests to the local server.

### Deployment to fly.io

There's a sample `fly.toml` file in the repo, i.e. **fly.example.toml**. Rename it to `fly.toml` or create your own `fly.toml` file with same content. Edit it and set the name for the app, and optionally change the machines type (or other settings) to match your needs.

```diff
# uncomment below and specify the name for your app
- # app = 'bun-static-host'
+ app = 'your-own-app-name'
# specify the primary region for your app
primary_region = 'arn'

[build]

[http_service]
  internal_port = 3000
  force_https = true
  auto_stop_machines = 'stop'
  auto_start_machines = true
  min_machines_running = 0
  processes = ['app']

[[vm]]
  memory = '256mb'
  cpu_kind = 'shared'
  cpus = 1
```

Then run `fly launch --no-deploy` to launch/scaffold the project.

Next, set the secrets using the command in case you haven't done that already:

```bash
fly secrets set AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=<KEY_ID> AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=<ACCESS_KEY> AWS_REGION=auto AWS_ENDPOINT=https://fly.storage.tigris.dev
```

Finally, run `fly deploy` to deploy the app.

You can scale the app to multiple machines and regions if needed (see [docs for details](https://fly.io/docs/flyctl/scale-count/)).

### Domains, DNS, and TLS Certificates

For the domain configuration, you'll need to set up DNS records for each domain you want to serve. Fly.io can handle TLS certificates for you, but you'll need to set up the DNS records to point to the app's IP address or Fly's subdomain.

You'll find more info on how to do this in their [docs](https://fly.io/docs/networking/custom-domain/). If you use Cloudflare for DNS, make sure you read this [section in that page](https://fly.io/docs/networking/custom-domain/#i-use-cloudflare-and-there-seems-to-be-a-problem-issuing-or-validating-my-fly-io-tls-certificate).

## Uploading Files With Buntastic CLI

While you can upload files to your bucket using the web console from Tigris, or the AWS CLI, you can also use the _Buntastic_ CLI to upload files to your Tigris/S3 bucket. It is designed to be simple to use, and also uploads faster compared to the other options.

You can use the CLI for your daily task, or use it in your CI/CD pipeline.

More details about how to install and use it can be found in the [CLI's README](/packages/cli/README.md).

## FAQ

Here are some common questions and answers.Please, if you have more question or have doubts/critic, please start a discussion :)

### Q: Why use bun-tastic instead of traditional static hosting?

It's fine to use traditional hosting service but if you're looking to selfhost your own static sites from a single (or distributed) machine, this is **FOR YOU**.

You have the flexibility to configure as much redirect/rewrite rules as you want. You could also add authorization/authentication rules to specific domains and routes, which can help you share content with specific users.

It's ideal for agencies, freelancers, or individuals who have many clients and projects, and they can easily manage them from one server and save cost.

### Q: Isn't it more expensive to selfhost?

It depends on your usage.

If you have just one website that gets a few hundred visits per day, it's probably cheaper to use a traditional static site host. However, if you have multiple websites or a high traffic site, self-hosting can be more cost-effective.

When you combine the flexibility and control of self-hosting, with the affordable cost of Tigris storage, volume-based licensing on [Fly.io](https://fly.io/pricing/), and the ability to scale to zero, then you can save a lot of money.

### Q: What are the benefits of bun-tastic?

See the [benefits section](#features-and-benefits-).

### Q: Can I use any S3-compatible storage?

Yes, any S3-compatible storage service will work.
